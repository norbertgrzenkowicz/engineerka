ITs been long time. 
Read a book about OpenCV. What knowledge did I gather useful for my graudation project?
Make and ML/DL model asap to evolve it around expirementing with techniques of image pre-processing
Thresholding? K - cluster for sure, maybe use already existing database to segmaent road ahead? 
Real-time computing is going to be challenging to achieve on raspberry pi
Detecting contours going to be useful
Augmented reality to transform angled camera output to 2d representation of the road detected
Later on try something on histograms.
Right now im going to focus on k-cluster, segmenting road and putting it as a 2d curve
See ya in September

Project has been changed. It's going to be an accessory for bikers to judge their current speed based on experience based on. Project hopefully will be limited to camera, Raspberry Pi with Tensorflow Lite and LED light.

TODO:
OpenCV interface to gather and pre-process data
Tensorflow Lite
Raspberry PI

Project Idea most likely figured out. It's going to be a drone with CV, mobile app steering.
Idea co-funded with two others co-founders, will add them to project in near future

1. Start CHECK
2. venv and OpenCV installation CHECK
3. Tensorflow, numpy, pandas, jupyter and so on HALF-CHECK
4. Set it up CHECK
5. ??? CHECK
6. Profit
